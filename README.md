# Machine Learning Demo
This project demonstrates using Machine Leaning model to identifiy objects in a picture.

Inspired by the [Ayoub Khyati's project on machine learning in iOS](https://github.com/ayoubkhayatti/GuessImageCoreML),
I decided to upload a more presentable version of the same including accessing pictures from camera.
